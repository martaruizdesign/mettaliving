<p>Are you longing for a place in your home conducive to your practice- whether it is yoga, meditation, journaling or playing music? This workshop will teach you how to bring beauty and balance into your home. We will focus on making changes to one specific area that will support your creative or spiritual practice and bring positive energy to the overall space.</p>
<p>You will learn how to chose the right location and what elements to implement for your individual needs. We will learn how to cultivate a healthy interior through identification of sattvic, rajasic and tamasic environments. Color, aromas and other methods of feeding the sense object will also be presented. With inspiration from this workshop, you will feel more connected to your home and your true self.</p> 
<p>“Creating a sacred space” is for people who are looking for ways to incorporate their spiritual life into their home surroundings. Whether you want to dedicate a small corner, or a whole room, you will learn the steps needed to start the transformation. </p>

<p>Altars are personal. They are created with specific intentions, different for each individual. They can connect us to spirit, encourage contemplation; they may be used for healing, prayer or centering.</p> 
<p>This workshop explores the different ways altars can live in your home or office. We will begin the process of how to  create one that is specific to you and where you may look for the objects you will place on it. Join us for a fun exploration of our hearts and souls and how they can help us in the manifestation of the altar.</p>
