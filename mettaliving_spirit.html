<p>Voted Traveler’s Choice Winner for Islands, this Turks and Caicos Island is one of the world’s top beach destinations. The diving and snorkeling is as convenient as it is stunning, thanks to miles of coral reef that’s easily accessible from the shore. The cliffs and crags of Chalk Sound make a lovely backdrop for kayaking the bright turquoise waters.  The Main Island of Providenciales is long and narrow.  Long Bay sits on the south/east side of the island. This is mostly a undeveloped area with just a few houses. This is the “wild” and “rugged” side of the island, where the kiters kite and horse back riders come for their beach rides.</p> 
<p>Though keeping that open and natural feeling, Long Bay is just 5 minutes from Grace Bay on the other side of the  island. There you’ll find upscale shops and restaurants. It’s a great place to do your shopping, have a night on the town, and then escape back to Long Bay serenity.</p>
