    		<p>How well you treat your body has a direct effect on how you feel. We don't always look carefully at our food, the substances we expose our bodies to, and our activities. <strong>Metta Living</strong> offers personal and group detoxification cleanses and custom bodywork treatments. With Ayurvedic guidelines for healthier living, implementing positive practices is easy and rewarding.</p>

information and sensuous experiences. With mindfulness, or intentional living, we can create from
these opportunities sanctuaries in space and time not only for ourselves, but for everyone
around us".</p>
