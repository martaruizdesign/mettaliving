<p>Are you longing for a place in your home where you can just "be"? Or a place conducive to your practice - whether it be Yoga, journaling or playing music?</p>
<p> Many of us disregard the importance of our surroundings. Studies show how our external environment plays a crucial role in our physical and mental well being. Ignoring our spaces and leaving them to develop in a haphazard way is doing ourselves a disservice.</p>
<p>Creating a sacred space does not have to be daunting or hugely challenging. In this Metta Living workshop we will focus on finding the right location in your home and transform it into a sacred space.

<p>Altars are personal. They are created with specific intentions, different for each individual. They can connect us to spirit, encourage contemplation; they may be used for healing, prayer or centering.</p> 
<p>This workshop explores the different ways altars can live in your home or office. We will begin the process of how to  create one that is specific to you and where you may look for the objects you will place on it. Join us for a fun exploration of our hearts and souls and how they can help us in the manifestation of the altar.</p>
